## 📌 Objective

The objective of this internship was to gain hands-on experience with Java programming by building real-time mini-projects. I worked on logic building, object-oriented programming (OOP), and user interaction using console-based Java applications.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: Guess the Number Game
- A simple game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it.
- Hints are given if the guess is too high or too low.
- Demonstrates use of loops, conditions, and random number generation.
- 📽️ Video demo : [Watch Demo] (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vedhavithya-s_java-programming-internship-activity-7238410777781489666-xn23?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD-e2agBDkmvS9I5dJ2wD8LY8jyd8X8_OvI)

### 🔹 Task 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- A console-based implementation of the classic game.
- User plays against the computer with input choices.
- Logic includes decision-making with `if-else` and `switch` statements.

### 🔹 Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe
- A two-player game played in the console.
- 3x3 board implemented using 2D arrays.
- Covers array operations, input handling, and game logic.
- - 📽️ Video demo : [Watch Demo] (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vedhavithya-s_javaprogramming-internship-internpe-activity-7242578101031870465-_yhh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD-e2agBDkmvS9I5dJ2wD8LY8jyd8X8_OvI)

### 🔹 Task 4: Connect Four
- A more advanced 2-player game where players drop pieces into a 6x7 grid.
- Game ends when one player connects four pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Focuses on nested loops, array manipulation, and win-checking logic.
